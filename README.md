# Welcome ! Below are the instructions.

We have provided you with a project which already has Redux, react, Styled Components and basic router all set up, also with an example of an action using Redux from the page you will be working on. We left the UI as bare as possible so to give you a fresh start on that part.

Add to this project the following:

- on the UI side : 

Please recreate this UI as closely as you can : 

![tasks - Desktop UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26336692/113589994-fac56c80-9629-11eb-80aa-30cb23187353.jpg)

Ignore any mobile version. 

- on the functionality side : 

Toggle the completion status of the task (completed - outstanding ) with a redux action. 
Don't forget to change the UI of the completion status accordingly on the task card (see UI above).

- bonus *(Note: his is by no means required.)*

If you'd like to add anything, feel free to do it! It is completely up to you. 

You could for example display the current tasks separately from the archived tasks, like so :

Or you could test your code. Or hook up any other form functionality! 


Have fun! 

If you have any questions. email Nathalia at : nathalia.rus@custodian.club and she will come back to you ASAP!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
